    <p>This Dhaba Style Chicken Curry stands for every road trip we've had with our families. Same bold flavours, ready in under 45 minutes -it's hot and fragrant and is made with ground spices, onions and tomatoes. I've shared how to make this recipe in a traditional pressure cooker, instant pot and on the stovetop.</p>
